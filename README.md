# Quasar and Firebase Authentication
For this demo to work you have to create a firebase project in Google Cloud Platform and copy the firebase config to the firebase.js file. For more information about how the firebase authentication was implemented look at this page https://github.com/BoMarconiHenriksen/quasar-and-firebase-authentication/blob/master/Firebase.md  

## Install the dependencies

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```
