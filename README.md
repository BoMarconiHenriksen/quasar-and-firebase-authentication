# Quasar and Firebase Authentication
For this demo to work you have to create a firebase project in Google Cloud Platform and copy the firebase config to the firebase.js file.  

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```
